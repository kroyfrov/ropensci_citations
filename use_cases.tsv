Occurrences extracted from GBIF were limited to those found within North America, and records from 1980 to present. Kane et al. (2017) express that it is good practice to model distributions based on a larger area that encompasses the smaller geographic area, in order to increase the background data provided for the MaxEnt model and ensure that a broad range of environmental conditions are represented for each species. Also, by encompassing a much broader extent than the focal area, we ensure that when predicting future distributions in response to climate change (see below), we accommodate species whose ranges may shift into the focal region from elsewhere	use GBIF data to construct species distributions models

To test for Allen’s Rule, we performed multiple linear regressions, with bill or foot size as response variables, and latitude (or SST) and body size as predictors.

For each urban area, we used the rnoaa package in R and custom R scripts to find all weather stations within the urban area boundary that contained a complete time series of climatological records (monthly means of minimum and maximum temperature and total precipitation) for the contemporary reference period (1960–1990). If fewer than five weather stations within the urban area boundary met these requirements, stations outside the urban area boundary were searched, up to a maximum of 50 km from the urban area centroid, until five stations meeting the data requirements were found. Climate records were then averaged across stations using inverse distance weighting to down weight the contribution of records more distant from the urban area centroid. The monthly records were then aggregated to the four climatological seasons to match the contemporary climate normals and future climate projections	estimate interannual climatic variability in urban areas

rentrez	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003472	research	NguyenEtal2014PlosCompBiol.pdf	We searched the key word '(myocardial infarction) AND (plasma OR serum)'' on PubMed with 'Homo Sapiens' as species from Jan 1, 2005 until May 31, 2013. This search resulted in 4326 abstracts. To reduce laborious manual effort, we developed a data mining program written in R using available XML parser and text mining software [58,59]	search PubMed for mentions of phrases
rentrez	NA	research	LeeEtal2017Code4Lib.pdf	By using the ‘rentrez’ package for R and the NLM’s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez Utilities API, we are able to efficiently and accurately select repository records for inclusion in the NCBI LinkOut for IRs program	demonstrate how to use rentrez to search NCBI API for articles in institutional repositories

rentrez	10.1101/260398	research	Claypool&Patel2018Biorxiv.pdf	We cataloged and downloaded gene expression and sample data from twenty (20) publicly available microarray studies that assayed gene expression before and after physical activity in healthy participants. We selected these studies from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) ... We used the rentrez R package [46] to execute the query on GEO	use NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus service
